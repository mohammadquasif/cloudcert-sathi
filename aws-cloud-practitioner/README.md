## 💡 Top Exam Tips (Based on the 65 Question Set)

- **Shared Responsibility Model** — Know exactly what AWS owns (hardware, hypervisor) vs what you own (OS, apps, data)
- **S3 Storage Classes** — Know when to use Standard, Glacier Instant Retrieval, and Deep Archive
- **EC2 Pricing** — On-Demand (short-term), Reserved (long-term, discounted), Spot (interruptible, cheapest)
- **CloudTrail vs Config** — CloudTrail tracks WHO did WHAT; Config tracks WHAT the resource configuration IS
- **WAF vs Shield** — WAF protects against Layer 7 attacks (SQL injection, XSS); Shield protects against DDoS
- **Cost Explorer vs Pricing Calculator vs Budgets** — Explorer=analyze past, Calculator=estimate future, Budgets=set alerts
- **RDS vs DynamoDB vs Redshift** — RDS=SQL/OLTP, DynamoDB=NoSQL key-value, Redshift=data warehouse OLAP
- **EFS vs EBS vs FSx** — EFS=shared Linux NFS, EBS=single EC2 block storage, FSx=Windows SMB
- **SQS vs SNS vs EventBridge** — SQS=queue/decouple, SNS=push notifications, EventBridge=event routing
- **IAM Roles** — Always attach roles to services, never embed access keys in EC2
