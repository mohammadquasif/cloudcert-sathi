## 💡 Top Exam Tips (Based on the 65 Question Set)

- **Shared Responsibility Model** — Know exactly what AWS owns (hardware, hypervisor, physical security) vs what you own (OS, apps, customer data, IAM policies).
- **S3 Storage Classes** — Know when to use Standard (frequent), Glacier Instant Retrieval (rarely accessed but needs ms retrieval), and Deep Archive (cheapest, 12-hour retrieval).
- **EC2 Pricing** — On-Demand (short-term, unpredictable), Reserved (1-3 years, highly predictable), Spot (interruptible, batch processing, cheapest).
- **CloudTrail vs Config** — CloudTrail tracks WHO did WHAT (API calls); Config tracks WHAT the resource configuration IS (compliance).
- **WAF vs Shield** — WAF protects against Layer 7 application attacks (SQL injection, XSS); Shield protects against DDoS attacks.
- **Cost Explorer vs Pricing Calculator vs Budgets** — Explorer = analyze past spend, Calculator = estimate future costs before deploying, Budgets = set alerts when costs exceed thresholds.
- **RDS vs DynamoDB vs Redshift** — RDS = SQL/OLTP (transactions), DynamoDB = NoSQL key-value (millisecond latency), Redshift = data warehouse OLAP (analytics).
- **EFS vs EBS vs FSx** — EFS = shared Linux NFS across multiple EC2 instances, EBS = single EC2 block storage (C: drive), FSx = Windows SMB server.
- **SQS vs SNS vs EventBridge** — SQS = queue/decouple components (polling), SNS = push notifications (pub/sub), EventBridge = complex event routing.
- **IAM Roles** — Always attach roles to EC2 instances to access other services; never embed hardcoded access keys in code.
- **Macie vs GuardDuty vs Inspector** — Macie discovers sensitive data (PII) in S3; GuardDuty monitors malicious activity and threats; Inspector scans EC2/ECR for software vulnerabilities.
- **Serverless Pattern** — The classic `API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB` combination is heavily tested as the ultimate serverless architecture.
