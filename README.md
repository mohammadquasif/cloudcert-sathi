## 🎯 Where to Focus to Get Certified (Based on Mock Tests)

Before you begin, understand where the bulk of the exam questions come from. Focus your energy on these high-weightage topics:

### 🟧 AWS Cloud Practitioner Focus Areas
> **Over 60% of the exam** focuses on Security and Cloud Technology. Pay extra attention to:
- **Service Comparisons**: Know exactly when to use *Macie* (PII data) vs *GuardDuty* (threats) vs *Inspector* (vulnerabilities).
- **Serverless Architecture**: The classic `API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB` pattern appears frequently.
- **Billing & Cost**: Differentiate between *Cost Explorer* (past analysis), *Pricing Calculator* (future estimates), and *AWS Budgets* (alerts).
- **Shared Responsibility**: Always remember AWS manages the hypervisor and physical hardware; you manage the OS, data, and IAM.

### 🟦 Claude Architect Foundation Focus Areas
> **~50% of the exam** focuses on Tool Use and Agentic Patterns. Pay extra attention to:
- **Tool Use & MCP**: Understand that MCP connects to servers, while Tool Use is how Claude executes functions. Always use specific, detailed tool descriptions.
- **Handling Data Absence**: If extraction data is missing, the schema must return `null` — Claude should never fabricate missing data.
- **Safety Gates**: Irreversible actions (like deleting resources or sending emails) must have a human-in-the-loop confirmation step.
- **Code Review**: Independent reviews (in a fresh session) are necessary to avoid confirmation bias from the code generator.
