## 🗂️ Exam Domain Breakdown

| Domain | Estimated Weight | What It Tests |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Fundamentals & Architecture | ~15% | What Claude is, how the agentic loop works, context windows |
| Agentic Patterns & Multi-Agent Systems | ~25% | Orchestrators, workers, prompt chaining, routing, session management |
| Tool Use & MCP Design | ~25% | Tool definitions, error handling, MCP architecture, safety gates |
| Structured Output & Extraction | ~20% | JSON schemas, ambiguity, batch processing, human review |
| Claude Code & Developer Workflows | ~15% | CLAUDE.md, Skills, session resumption, code review patterns |

**Tool Use and Agentic Patterns together = ~50% of the exam. Focus here first.**

## 💡 Top Exam Tips (Based on the 60 Question Set)

- **The Agentic Loop** — Know the `observe → think → act → observe` cycle deeply. When an agent gets an error, it observes it and thinks about a retry strategy.
- **Tool Error Handling** — `isError: true` + structured error metadata (`errorCategory`, `isRetryable`) is the standard pattern. Never throw raw backend exceptions directly to Claude.
- **Context Degradation vs Limits** — Even if a 190,000-token document fits within the 200,000 limit, effective attention degrades near the end. Use overlapping chunking to extract scattered information reliably.
- **Handling Missing Data (Null vs Fabrication)** — When extracting data, type optional fields as `['string', 'null']`. If the data isn't in the source text, returning `null` is mandatory. Do not let Claude fabricate "Not Specified" strings.
- **Safety Gates for Irreversible Actions** — Any action with real-world consequences (deleting workspaces, sending emails, booking rooms) *must* include a Human-in-the-Loop step. A programmatic token exchange is the safest way to enforce this.
- **Routing vs Chaining** — Use *Routing* when you have different inputs that need different handlers (e.g., classify language first). Use *Prompt Chaining* when you have a sequential, multi-step process where step B requires step A's output.
- **Independent Code Review** — A fresh agent session reviewing code avoids confirmation bias. An agent reviewing its own generated code will just confirm its own design intent.
- **Plan Mode & Exploration** — For large unfamiliar codebases, use "Architecture-first exploration" (orient, locate core class, trace). For major refactors, use Plan Mode to document the impact on all dependencies *before* changing anything.
- **MCP vs Tool Use** — MCP is a protocol for connecting Claude to external servers without hardcoding integrations; Tool Use is the underlying mechanism Claude uses to execute those functions.
- **CLAUDE.md vs Skills** — `CLAUDE.md` is for universal, always-on project standards. `Skills` are for infrequent, on-demand tasks (like load testing) to save context window tokens.
